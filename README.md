# Object detection AgNOR
This project is part of Semester project for a Computer Vision course, the goal of which was to train an Object Detector and Classifier for detection and classification of AgNORs used in Cancer detection.
The dataset for the training was provided by the university and since its licensing information is not clear, it will not be uploaded to this repository.

The selected model for object detection was FasterRCNN from PyTorch's torchvision using the FasterRCNN_MobileNet_V3_Large_FPN_Weights pre-trained weights as the starting point. For the classification, a custom CNN was created.
